# Lamian

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/lamian`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## TODO

- Add good threading (`Thread.new` core ext???)
